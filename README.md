Flow Chart
----------

[app.js (Angular routes)]

-> [views/ (Angular)] 
-> [controllers/ (Angular)]
-> [routes [Express]] 
-> [controllers/ (Express)] 
-> [models/ [Mongoose]] 
-> [MongoDB (NoSQL DB)]

To avoid confusion, the node app.js file is renamed: server.js



English Explanation of architecture
-----------------------------------

URL is read by app.js, which renders the corresponding partial in the views folder.

Functionality within each view is handled by the containing controller. 

Communication to the back-end is delegated the factories.

Factories make Ajax requests ($http) to the back-end where the routes file directs them to the proper controller.

The controller utilizes the mongoose library to communicate with MongoDB and send a response back to the front end.
